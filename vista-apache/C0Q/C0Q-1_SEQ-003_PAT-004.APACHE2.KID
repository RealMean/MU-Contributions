 This patch adds the ability to generate modified CCRs
"BLD",7898,1,12,0)
 containing a QUALITY measure section that looks like
"BLD",7898,1,13,0)
 this:

 This enables you to create a QRDA document in the C32 format to submit to CMS
"BLD",7898,1,27,0)
 containing these measures. The C32 document will be generated by an XSLT
"BLD",7898,1,28,0)
 transform from the CCR document.

 This enables you to create a QRDA document in the C32 format to submit to CMS
"PKG",211,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
 containing these measures. The C32 document will be generated by an XSLT
"PKG",211,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
 transform from the CCR document.
