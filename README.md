Contents of email from Oroville:

Attached are the items WV put in place when we performed Certification I/MU I on our current VistA product.  All routines which COULD be changed to APACHE have been changed.  Please review and let’s discuss.

The items created for VistACom, used for secure messaging and CCR/CCD files, ePrescribe, and PQRI reporting are on the WV website as GPL.   I have the APACHE version of the product(s) however, it’s an 80G file….how can I get this to you?
 
Below is naming convention for those:
 
C0C = CCR/CCD package
C0Q = Quality Reporting package
C0P = eRx package
 
All above should be released thru OSEHRA.
